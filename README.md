# Microservice Spring Boot

This project was created in order to try out some features of microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

This example contains some basics concepts of RESTful web services. 

This projects uses multiple features - versioning, exception handling, documentation (Swagger), basic authentication (Spring Security), filtering and HATEOAS. 

In this project, I used Spring (Dependency Management), Spring MVC (or Spring REST), Spring Boot, Spring Security (Authentication and Authorization), Spring Boot Actuator (Monitoring), Swagger (Documentation), Maven (dependencies management), Postman (REST Services Client) and Tomcat Embedded Web Server.

This example was built while I was doing https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud
